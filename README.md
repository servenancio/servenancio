Hello! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm Sergio, professor of Design and Computation at Inteli - Institute of Technology and Leadership, where we train the future technology leaders of Brazil. We prepare our students to the reality of market, academy and entrepreneurship, showing that technology and cutting-edge training are important and so is the human side of them.

Our methodology follows Project Based Learning, and focus on developing creative solutions to real challenges from day one. We combine teaching excellence with socio-emotional skills and entrepreneurship. And in addition to avant-garde knowledge, Inteli students learn to work collaboratively and transform the world with creativity and intelligence.

Feel free to contact me or visit us in our campus in S√£o Paulo.
